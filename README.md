# <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrian-cagadas-8b8927128/">Adrian Cagadas</a>'s IT and Cybersecurity Project Portfolio üîê

With over 11 years of experience in IT support and systems troubleshooting, I currently serve as a Cybersecurity Support Engineer at LOG(N) Pacific. My role centers on triaging security alerts, performing threat hunting, and developing detection rules within Azure environments. Leveraging tools like Microsoft Sentinel and Defender for Endpoint, I help automate workflows, monitor malicious activity, and support incident response through customized dashboards and KQL-based workbooks. My focus is on securing enterprise systems by implementing robust configurations and enabling proactive threat detection. Previous roles have honed my expertise in endpoint management, network stability, and IT operations, which I now apply to safeguard cloud environments and mitigate modern cyber threats. Passionate about collaboration, I work to empower teams with actionable insights and secure infrastructure solutions.

I'm passionate about cybersecurity and love tackling complex challenges through hands-on projects. From vulnerability management to threat detection, these projects allow me to dive deep into the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity. Please feel free to check them out and see the work I‚Äôve put into enhancing security operations and processes!
